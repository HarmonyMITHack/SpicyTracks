## Project Description
Our team came together during the **MIT for Reality Hack 2025** through a shared passion for music and a vision to make it more accessible to everyone. While many people love music, it remains inaccesible to some—whether due to a lack of musical training or mobility limitations. Traditional instruments can be challenging or even impossible for those individuals to play, making co-music-making even more difficult. 

To bridge this gap, we designed **SpicyTracks**: a new music-making experience inspired by the kitchen. Kitchens are spaces of creativity, learning, and experimentation—often used in cognitive training. This approach makes music more inclusive and accessible to a wider audience. Plus, it’s fun and boosts mental well-being!

## How to Play

### Interactions
SpicyTracks has 3 interaction methods for diverse mobility needs:

1. Grabbing with Hands 
2. Poking with Hands 
3. Gaze with Head (activates sounds by simply looking)

Gaze-Controlled Instruments: Boxes, Spice Rack, Glasses
Hand-Controlled Instruments: Frying Pans & Toaster
Microwave:
- Start/Stop Recording:  Begin or end your musical session.
- Trash & Restart: Don’t like your current track? Use the microwave to discard and start fresh.
- Background Track**: The microwave provides a background beat with 3 levels of intensity to inspire your compositions.
